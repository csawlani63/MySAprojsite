            Malware or "malicious software", describes any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems. The motive for this could be to make money from you or sabotage your ability to get work done. They cannot harm physical hardware (few exceptions), however they can steal, encrypt or delete your data, or spy on your computer activity without your knowledge. If you want to try this malware, I recommend turning off any antivirus and/or windows defender.
          </p>
          <p class="section-2-paragraph2">
            Most common ways to prevent malware attacks is to have a very good antivirus enabled alongside windows defender such as mcafee. These programs detect malware using existing common signatures and heuristics, and then remove them from your computer. There are still some malware that can be undetectable, however most malware can be detected and removed as it is installed on your device, or using a full scan of your device.

            Malware types and what they do:<br>&#x2022;Adware - unwanted software that throws advertisements on your screen<br>&#x2022;Spyware - malware that observes the user's computer activities<br>&#x2022;Virus - malware that replicates itself and modifies other computer programs<br>&#x2022;Trojans - malware that gives access to the device to an unauthorized user<br>&#x2022;Ransomeware - malware that locks you out of your device or encrypts your files, then forces you to pay a ransom to regain access<br>&#x2022;Rootkit - malware that provides the attacker with admin privileges on the infected system<br>&#x2022;Keylogger - malware that records all the user's keystrokes on the keyboard and sends it back to the attacker<br>&#x2022;Worm - a malware that self-replicates but unlike viruses, can do so without an action from the user

            My malware called NotChiragsMalware, can perform numerous functions through simple commands from my terminal, onto the victim's computer. A list of self-defined commands include:<br>&#x2022;q - terminate the connection to the server<br>&#x2022;keylog_start - start the built-in keylogger<br>&#x2022;persist - the malware starts up automatically whenever the user's device starts up<br>Other commands such as dir to view the current directory, or type to view the contents of a text file can be run without any additional code for it, since they are existing commands on a windows terminal.<br>Even a barebones malware can cause a lot of damage. Assuming there is a malware on the user's device with no additional commands, it can still delete any file or folder that the attacker chooses or sensitive information can be leaked by viewing your files remotely from the attacker's device.
